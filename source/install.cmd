REM ============================================
REM   ClaudeCode Launchpad CLI - Dependency Installer
REM   Uses only standard, trusted tooling:
REM     - winget (Microsoft-signed) as the primary installer for Node/Git/WT
REM     - curl.exe (built-in Windows 10 1803+) for Anthropic's official script
REM   Deliberately avoids "LOLBin" download tricks (certutil/bitsadmin) and
REM   script-driven elevation where a trusted installer can do the job, because
REM   those patterns trip antivirus heuristics and look suspicious to users.
REM ============================================

REM --- Version Pins (update these for new releases) ---
set "NODE_VERSION=22.15.0"
set "NODE_URL=https://nodejs.org/dist/v%NODE_VERSION%/node-v%NODE_VERSION%-x64.msi"
set "GIT_VERSION=2.49.0"
set "GIT_URL=https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v%GIT_VERSION%.windows.1/Git-%GIT_VERSION%-64-bit.exe"
set "TEMP_DIR=%TEMP%\ClaudeCodeSetup"
set "EXIT_CODE=0"

REM --- Persistent logs (per-user, survive the run so a failed install leaves
REM     evidence on disk). KIVUN_LOG gets this script's own output; NODE_MSI_LOG
REM     gets msiexec's verbose log when the Node MSI fallback is used. ---
set "KIVUN_DIR=%LOCALAPPDATA%\Kivun"
set "KIVUN_LOG=%KIVUN_DIR%\install-log.txt"
set "NODE_MSI_LOG=%KIVUN_DIR%\node-msi.log"
if not exist "%KIVUN_DIR%" mkdir "%KIVUN_DIR%" 2>nul

REM --- Robust curl config (ROOT-CAUSE FIX for the stalled Claude download).
REM     Windows' built-in curl uses the schannel TLS backend, which aborts large
REM     HTTPS downloads from CDNs (Cloudflare / HTTP-2) with
REM     "(56) schannel: server closed abruptly (missing close_notify)" or
REM     "(35) Send failure: Connection was reset" - schannel has no HTTP
REM     termination point for the stream and treats the missing TLS close as a
REM     possible truncation attack. Forcing HTTP/1.1 gives every response a
REM     Content-Length terminator (so curl never depends on close_notify), and
REM     the retries ride out transient resets.
REM
REM     We publish this through CURL_HOME, which curl reads a .curlrc from. That
REM     means not only OUR curl calls but ALSO Anthropic's bootstrap.cmd - which
REM     fetches the ~50 MB claude.exe with a bare `curl -fsSL` and has NO retry
REM     of its own - inherit the same resilience, because child processes
REM     inherit CURL_HOME. CURL_HOME is only set inside this script's process
REM     (setlocal), so the user's own curl is unaffected after install.
set "CURL_HOME=%KIVUN_DIR%"
> "%KIVUN_DIR%\.curlrc" (
    echo http1.1
    echo retry = 5
    echo retry-all-errors
    echo retry-delay = 2
    echo ssl-no-revoke
    echo connect-timeout = 30

mkdir "%TEMP_DIR%" 2>nul

REM --- Header line in the persistent log ---
echo.>> "%KIVUN_LOG%"
echo ===== %DATE% %TIME% :: install.cmd %* =====>> "%KIVUN_LOG%"

REM --- Dispatch to subroutines. Each subroutine prints clean, user-facing
REM     milestones to the screen via :say while sending the noisy command
REM     output (winget spinners, msiexec, curl meters) only to the log, so the
REM     installer console never looks like a frozen black window. ---

REM   SUBROUTINES
REM ============================================

REM --- :say "message" - echo to the screen AND append to the log, so the user
REM     sees progress live and the same line is preserved for diagnostics. The
REM     leading-redirect form avoids a trailing digit in the message being
REM     mistaken for a stream handle. ---

REM dozens of releases behind while the updater reports itself healthy. The
REM bootstrap happens to default to `latest` today, but that default is theirs to
REM change and ours to depend on, so we state it rather than inherit it.
