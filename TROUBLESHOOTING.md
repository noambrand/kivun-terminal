# Troubleshooting

Common issues and fixes for ClaudeCode Launchpad CLI.

---

## Windows

### "Claude Code not found" on launch

Claude Code isn't in your PATH.

```
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

Then close and reopen the terminal.

### Windows Terminal colors not applying

The installer uses ANSI escape sequences as a fallback, so colors should work even without the WT profile. If you see no colors:

1. Make sure **Windows Terminal** is installed (`winget install Microsoft.WindowsTerminal`)
2. Re-run the installer - it registers a WT JSON fragment automatically
3. If using CMD fallback, verify your Windows 10 build supports 24-bit ANSI (build 1903+)

### Folder picker doesn't open

The GUI folder picker requires Windows Script Host. If it's disabled by policy:

- Cancel the picker - a text input prompt will appear where you can type or paste a path

### Desktop shortcut does nothing

Right-click the shortcut > Properties > verify the target points to:

```
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Kivun\claudecode-launchpad.bat
```

### Right-click context menu missing

Re-run the installer as Administrator. The context menu entry is added to the registry during installation.

### Download failed during installation

The installer uses `curl.exe` (built-in on Windows 10 1803+) to download Node.js and Git. If downloads fail:

1. **Firewall/proxy** - corporate firewalls may block `nodejs.org` or `github.com`. Ask your IT team to whitelist these domains
2. **No internet** - an internet connection is required during installation
3. **curl missing** - on very old Windows 10 builds (before 1803), curl may not exist. The installer falls back to winget automatically
4. **Manual install** - if all else fails, install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) manually, then re-run the installer (it will detect them and skip)

## macOS

### Installer blocked by Gatekeeper

This is expected for non-notarized packages:

1. Double-click the `.pkg` - macOS will block it
2. Go to **System Settings > Privacy & Security**
3. Scroll to the bottom, click **Allow Anyway**
4. Double-click the `.pkg` again

### `claude: command not found`

The installer adds Claude Code via npm. If the command isn't found:

```bash
# Check if npm is available
which npm

# Reinstall Claude Code
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# If npm is missing, reinstall via Homebrew
brew install node
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

Make sure your shell profile (`.zshrc` or `.bash_profile`) includes the npm global bin in PATH.

## Status Bar

### Status bar not showing

1. Check that `statusline.mjs` exists:
   - Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Kivun\statusline.mjs`
   - macOS: `/usr/local/share/kivun/statusline.mjs`
2. Verify Claude Code settings:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.claude/settings.json
   ```
   Should contain a `"statusLine"` entry with `"lines": 2`.
3. If missing, re-run the installer or manually run:
   ```bash
   node configure-statusline.js "<path-to-statusline.mjs>"
   ```

### Only one status line visible

Claude Code defaults to 1 line. The installer sets `"lines": 2` in `~/.claude/settings.json`. If it reverted, edit the file and set:

```json
"statusLine": {
  "type": "command",
  "command": "node \"/path/to/statusline.mjs\"",
  "lines": 2
}
```
