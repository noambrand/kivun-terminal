![ClaudeCode Launchpad CLI Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noambrand/kivun-terminal/main/claudecode_launchpad_GIF.gif)

## Windows

1. Download **ClaudeCode_Launchpad_CLI_Setup.exe** below
2. Run as Administrator - follow the wizard
3. Double-click the "ClaudeCode Launchpad CLI" desktop shortcut

> **Note:** The installer may close open terminal windows during setup. Save your work before running.

## macOS

1. Download **ClaudeCode_Launchpad_CLI_Setup_mac.pkg** below
2. **Right-click** the `.pkg` file → **Open** (required - macOS blocks unsigned packages on double-click)
3. Enter your password when prompted
4. After install, you'll have:
   - **Desktop shortcut** with folder picker dialog
   - **Right-click menu** on any folder in Finder
   - **Language configuration** (24+ languages)

> The .pkg is small (~3 KB) because it's a script-only installer - all dependencies are downloaded via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) during installation.
