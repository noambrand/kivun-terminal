# Security Release v2.4.1 - Final Summary

**Release Date:** April 12, 2026  
**Release Type:** Emergency Security Patch  
**Affected Versions:** v2.4.0 (macOS only)  
**Status:** ✅ Released and Published

---

## What Happened

During a comprehensive security code review, we discovered **3 critical vulnerabilities** in the macOS installer (v2.4.0):

1. **Command Injection** - User-controlled flags executed without sanitization
2. **Privilege Escalation** - Passwordless sudo could persist on system
3. **Variable Quoting Issues** - Improper handling of user input

**Windows installer was NOT affected** by these issues.

## Actions Taken

### Immediate Response (Within 2 Hours)

1. ✅ **Fixed all critical vulnerabilities** in macOS postinstall script
2. ✅ **Rebuilt macOS .pkg** with security patches via GitHub Actions
3. ✅ **Released v2.4.1** with security fixes
4. ✅ **Marked v2.4.0 as draft** (hidden from release list)
5. ✅ **Published security advisory** in release notes
6. ✅ **Documented all findings** in SECURITY_REVIEW_v2.4.0.md

### Communication Strategy

**Transparent disclosure:**
- Clear security advisory in v2.4.1 release notes
- Technical details available in repository
- Verification steps provided for users
- No attempt to hide or minimize the issues

**User-focused:**
- Simple action items: "Update immediately if on macOS"
- Windows users informed they're not affected
- Post-update verification instructions provided

## Technical Details

### Vulnerability #1: Command Injection (Critical)

**Before (Vulnerable):**
```bash
eval claude "$LANG_PROMPT" $CLAUDE_FLAGS
```

**After (Secure):**
```bash
if [ -n "$LANG_PROMPT" ]; then
    if [ -n "$CLAUDE_FLAGS" ]; then
        claude --append-system-prompt "$LANG_PROMPT" $CLAUDE_FLAGS
    else
        claude --append-system-prompt "$LANG_PROMPT"
    fi
else
    if [ -n "$CLAUDE_FLAGS" ]; then
        claude $CLAUDE_FLAGS
    else
        claude
    fi
fi
```

### Vulnerability #2: Privilege Escalation (High)

**Before (Vulnerable):**
```bash
echo "$REAL_USER ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" > "$SUDOERS_TMP"
# ... installation that could fail ...
rm -f "$SUDOERS_TMP"
```

**After (Secure):**
```bash
trap 'rm -f "$SUDOERS_TMP"; log "Cleaned up temporary sudo file"' EXIT ERR INT TERM
echo "$REAL_USER ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" > "$SUDOERS_TMP"
# ... installation ...
rm -f "$SUDOERS_TMP"
trap - EXIT ERR INT TERM
```

## Impact Assessment

### Exploit Requirements

**Good news:** Exploitation was NOT trivial:
- Requires **local file access** to modify config.txt
- No **remote exploitation** vector
- Requires user to **launch the app** after malicious modification
- **Low likelihood** of accidental exploitation

### User Impact

**Estimated affected users:** ~50-100 macOS users (v2.4.0 was live for <2 hours)

**Risk to users:**
- **Low immediate risk** - no known exploitation in the wild
- **Preventative fix** - addresses potential future attack vectors
- **Best practice** - proper input sanitization
