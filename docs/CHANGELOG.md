# Changelog

## [3.1.0] - 2026-09-03

### Added: Claude Code now stays on Anthropic's current release channel

Anthropic publishes Claude Code on two channels. `stable` is conservative and can sit on
the same build for weeks; `latest` is the current one. Whichever channel a machine installed
from is the one its built-in auto-updater follows from then on, so a Claude installed without
an explicit channel quietly falls behind while reporting itself up to date. Measured on
2026-09-03: `stable` was at 2.1.236 and `latest` at 2.1.258, twenty-two releases apart.

Launchpad now puts Claude on `latest` on every install and every upgrade, on both platforms:

- A fresh install passes `latest` to Anthropic's installer, so the first build is the current
  one and the updater follows the current channel from then on.
- An upgrade on a machine that already has Claude runs the new `configure-fast-updates.js`,
  which writes one key, `"autoUpdatesChannel": "latest"`, into `~/.claude/settings.json`.
  It downloads nothing; Claude's own updater picks up the newer build on its next check.
  Everything else in the settings file is left exactly as it was, and a settings file that
  cannot be parsed is left alone rather than overwritten.
- The macOS package does the same: `latest` on a fresh install, `claude install latest` when
  Claude is already there.
- The server recovery script passes `latest` too, so a repaired server does not come back a
  month behind.

If the channel cannot be set, the installer says so and carries on. Claude still works; it
just updates on the slower schedule.

### Changed

- The picker screenshot in the README was refreshed.

## [3.0.3] - 2026-08-19

### Fixed — "the path was not found", so Claude never started

Reported from the field: picking a project folder ended with a path error in the terminal
and no Claude. Cause: a trailing backslash on the picked folder. Inside a quoted argument
a trailing backslash **escapes the closing quote**, so

```
wt.exe ... -d "Y:\" -- "<launcher>.bat" --run
```

reaches Windows Terminal as ONE mangled argument (`Y:" -- <launcher>.bat --run`) instead of
three — Windows Terminal reports the starting directory cannot be found and the tab dies
before Claude runs. Measured on a real path: with the trailing slash a child process
received 1 argument instead of 3; without it, all 3 arrive intact. It bites whenever the
picked folder is a drive root (the browse dialog returns `Y:\`) or the path was typed with
a trailing slash — a Hebrew folder name is NOT required, though that is where it surfaced.

The launcher now normalises the work directory before using it: strip a trailing backslash,
and restore a bare drive letter as `Y:\.` so it remains a real directory. The tab title
already did this; the directory itself did not. Same fix applied to Kivun Terminal.

### Changed — an unreachable folder now says so, and never opens a different one

If the chosen folder cannot be reached for any other reason (the classic one: a mapped
network drive that is not connected yet), Windows Terminal used to answer with a bare
`error 0x80070002 ... cannot find the file specified` and the tab died — the user could not
tell what was not found. The launcher now checks first and shows a plain message naming the
path, in a terminal tab, since phase 1 runs hidden and an `echo` there would be invisible.

**It stops rather than substituting another folder.** Opening Claude somewhere the user did
not choose is worse than not opening it at all: they would start working and only later
notice the project was never loaded. Same rule applied to Kivun Terminal, whose silent
fall-back to the home directory was exactly that failure.

### Added — `tools/DIAGNOSE-HEBREW-PATH.cmd`

A double-click diagnostic for a machine where a non-English project path fails. It reports
the console codepage before/after `chcp 65001`, dumps the raw bytes of the last picked path,
checks whether that folder resolves, and runs a live Windows Terminal round-trip into a
Hebrew-named folder — then writes it all to the Desktop. It changes nothing on the machine
it runs on. Built because this class of bug differs per PC and guessing across machines
wasted releases before.

### Added — a clear warning on old Windows (Server 2012 R2 / 8.1)

On Windows versions older than Windows 10 / Server 2016, the install would appear to
run but two steps silently failed: Claude never downloaded (that old Windows has no
built-in `curl`, which the installer uses to fetch Claude) and the folder picker never
opened (no Edge **WebView2** runtime to draw its window). The result looked like a
broken product with two confusing error popups.

- The installer now **detects old Windows up front** and shows one plain message
  explaining exactly what is missing and recommending Windows 10/11 or Server 2019/2022,
  with a choice to stop (default) or continue at your own risk.
- A standalone **`server-recovery/` kit** (double-click `FIX-CLAUDE-ON-THIS-SERVER.cmd`)
  is included for anyone who must use such a server: it fetches a real `curl` via Node,
  installs Claude Code with Anthropic's official installer, and reports plainly whether
  Claude actually runs on that OS. On a server you use `claude` in a terminal; the
  picker window still needs WebView2, which that old OS cannot provide.

### Added — auto-continue "safe resume" + an `error` voice alert

Two small quality-of-life changes, both opt-outable:

- **Safe resume for auto-continue.** When the 5-hour limit resets, the watcher used
  to type a bare `continue`. It now (by default) types a short prompt that asks Claude
  to **run `git status` and re-read the file it was mid-edit on first**, so a change
  that already landed before the pause is reconciled instead of silently duplicated.
  This only guards the clean limit-reset resume — a hard crash mid-edit is still
  Claude's own checkpointing, not this. Turn it off with `AUTO_CONTINUE_SAFE_RESUME=false`
  in `config.txt` for the old plain `continue`. Only Claude can reconcile state, so the
  guard lives in the injected words, not in the (screen-blind) watcher.
- **`error` voice alert.** A fifth clip that is the failure counterpart of `done`:
  Claude plays `done` when a run finishes clean and `error` when it ends in a failure,
  so the sound alone tells you whether you're returning to a green result or a wall of
  red. Both clips are short; regular and funny versions included.

## [3.0.2] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed — a taskbar pin from an old version showed "folder-picker.hta is missing - reinstall"

If you pinned an **older** (pre-v3.0.0) version to your taskbar, clicking that pin
popped up *"folder-picker.hta is missing from ...\Kivun. Try reinstalling."* even
though the app was installed fine and the Desktop / Start-menu shortcuts worked.

**Why:** back then the picker launched through `folder-picker-launcher.wsf`, which
opens `folder-picker.hta`. v3.0.0 replaced both with the signed **LaunchpadPicker.exe**
and removed the `.hta` (the old `mshta.exe` + `.hta` combo kept tripping Windows
Defender). The installer updated the Desktop and Start-menu shortcuts, but **Windows
does not let an installer re-pin the taskbar** — so a taskbar pin kept its old target
and went on launching the retired `.wsf`, which then couldn't find the deleted `.hta`.

**Fix (this release):**
- The installer now **repoints an existing taskbar pin** to `LaunchpadPicker.exe`.
- It also **deletes the obsolete launcher leftovers** (`folder-picker-launcher.wsf`,
  `folder-picker.vbs`, the old `.js` launchers, and `folder-picker.hta.bak.*`) so the
  old flow can't run again.
- Fresh installs were never affected (they never shipped the `.wsf`). If you're an
  upgrader and the pin still misbehaves right after updating, sign out and back in
  once, or unpin it and re-pin from the Start-menu entry.

## [3.0.1] - 2026-07-26

### Changed — the Windows Terminal icon fixer is now signed too (second HTA retired)

`fix-wt-icon.hta` was the last remaining HTA in the product. Like the folder
picker before it, `mshta.exe` opening it could trip Windows Defender's LOLBin
heuristic. v3.0.1 retires it: the same signed **LaunchpadPicker.exe** now hosts
the icon fixer too, launched with a page argument (`LaunchpadPicker.exe
fix-wt-icon.html`). The exe gained one small bridge method (`CopyFile`, used for
the settings.json backup/restore) and an argument that selects which page to
host — with no argument it's the folder picker exactly as before, so existing
shortcuts are unaffected.

- New Start-menu entry: **ClaudeCode Launchpad CLI → Fix Windows Terminal Icon**.
- `fix-wt-icon.hta` is no longer installed and is removed on upgrade.
- No more HTAs ship in the product.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-07-25

### Changed — the folder picker is now a signed program, not an HTA (fixes the Defender false alarm)

Windows Defender's machine-learning heuristic repeatedly flagged the folder
picker as malware. The detection was never about the picker's contents or its
signature — it fires on the *command line* pattern `mshta.exe <a local .hta>`,
which is a common malware-delivery technique (a "living off the land" binary),
so it tripped no matter what the HTA did. Signing the launcher could not clear
it, because the process Defender sees is Microsoft's own `mshta.exe`, and an
`.hta` cannot carry a signature.

v3.0.0 removes `mshta` from the picture entirely. The picker is now
**LaunchpadPicker.exe**, a small signed native program that shows the *same*
window by hosting the existing picker UI inside the Microsoft Edge **WebView2**
control. The UI (layout, flags, profiles, colors, sounds, update check) is
unchanged — it is generated from the same source at build time — while the
handful of Windows operations it needs (read/write files, browse for a folder,
run a command) are handled by the signed program instead of ActiveX/COM.

Benefits: no more `mshta` LOLBin pattern for Defender to flag, the picker
process now carries the publisher's Authenticode signature (which builds
SmartScreen reputation over time), and the Start-menu / desktop shortcuts launch
the signed exe directly.

Notes:
- Requires the Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime, which ships with Windows 11 and
  with Microsoft Edge (so it is present on essentially all target machines). If
  it is ever missing, the picker shows a friendly message pointing to the free
  Microsoft download instead of failing silently.
- The legacy `folder-picker.hta` is no longer installed, and any leftover copy
  from a previous version is removed on upgrade.
- `.NET Framework 4.8` (built into Windows 10 1903+/11) is the only runtime the
  program itself needs — nothing extra to download.

## [2.9.3] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed — statusline now appears on a fresh PC without hand-editing settings.json

On a computer that did NOT already have Node.js, the installer installed Node in
an earlier step, but the installer process kept its OLD PATH for the rest of the
run. So the post-install steps that call `node ...` (statusline config, voice
alerts, terminal color, Windows Terminal profile) could not find `node` and
silently did nothing — most visibly, `~/.claude/settings.json` never got its
`statusLine` block, so Claude showed no statusline until the file was edited by
hand later (once a re-login had refreshed PATH). The installer now resolves
`node.exe` by its real path (`Program Files\nodejs`, with fallbacks) and calls it
directly, so these steps run reliably on a first-time install.

### Fixed — duplicate tabs on a fresh PC (the de-dupe was being skipped)

Same stale-PATH cause: the launcher gates its tab de-dupe behind
`where node && node dedupe-launch-tab.js`. On a fresh PC where `node` wasn't yet
on the Explorer-inherited PATH, that check failed and the de-dupe was skipped
entirely, so Windows Terminal's restore + the launcher's new tab produced two
identical tabs (which then got saved permanently). The launcher now adds Node's
real install dir to its PATH at the top of the script (same treatment Claude's
`.local\bin` already got), so the de-dupe — and the runtime statusline command
Claude spawns — work even before the first re-login.

### Fixed — two "ClaudeCode Launchpad CLI" rows in Add/Remove Programs

Some PCs showed the product **twice** in Apps & Features (e.g. an old `2.4.1`
alongside the current one). Cause: the earliest releases (pre-v2.6.4) installed
system-wide and wrote their uninstall entry to `HKLM` (needing admin); from v2.6.4
the installer went per-user and writes to `HKCU`. A per-user process can't delete
an `HKLM` key, so the old system-wide row was orphaned and lingered as a second
listing. The installer and uninstaller now clear that legacy `HKLM` entry in both
registry views (best-effort — it only takes effect when running elevated). New
installs never write `HKLM`, so no new duplicate can appear. For an existing ghost
on a PC where you can't elevate the installer, run the new one-click cleaner
`tools/Remove-Duplicate-Entry.cmd` (it self-elevates and removes ONLY the old
system-wide entry — never your current install, never the separate Kivun Terminal).

### Changed — "Create Desktop Shortcut" on the finish page is now ticked by default

The final-page checkbox is checked (V) by default, so the desktop icon is created
unless the user unticks it.

## [2.9.2] - 2026-07-13

### Fixed — opening a session no longer shows two tabs with the same project name

If Windows Terminal was set to reopen your tabs on startup (its
"firstWindowPreference": "persistedWindowLayout" option), a cold start restored
the previously-saved Launchpad tab for a project AND the launcher then opened a
fresh tab for that same project — so you got two identical tabs side by side.

Rather than turn tab-restore off (which would lose it for every window), the
launcher now prunes ONLY the tab for the project you're opening from Windows
Terminal's saved layout, immediately before it opens the window. Restore still
brings back everything else — other projects, other windows, non-Launchpad tabs
— and the launcher supplies this one project exactly once. Full restore, no
duplicate.

New `source/dedupe-launch-tab.js` (run in phase 1 of the launcher) does the
prune. It is best-effort and defensive: on a missing/unparsable state file, or an
unexpected shape, it does nothing and the launch proceeds normally. It only ever
touches tabs whose command line is the Launchpad launcher AND whose working
folder/title matches the project being opened, so other tabs are never disturbed.
Verified with isolated tests (target pruned; other project + PowerShell tab kept;
match-by-folder; malformed-state left untouched; same-named non-Launchpad tab not
pruned).

Note: this targets the common cold-start case. If Windows Terminal is already
open and the same project's tab is already showing, opening it again can still add
a second tab in that running window.

## [2.9.1] - 2026-07-13

### Fixed — Windows Terminal "invalid colorScheme" warning on install

Some installs showed *"Found a profile with an invalid colorScheme. Defaulting
that profile to the default colors"* when Windows Terminal started. Cause:
`source/apply-terminal-color.js` is meant to also write our "Launchpad Color"
scheme *into* `settings.json` (so the profile's pin always resolves), but it read
the file with a strict `JSON.parse`. Windows Terminal's `settings.json` normally
contains `//` comments (JSONC), so the parse threw and the script hit its safety
bail — never writing the scheme. Windows Terminal still materialized the profile
with `colorScheme: "Launchpad Color"` (inherited from the fragment), so if the
fragment wasn't merged at that instant (install race / an already-open window),
the pin pointed at a scheme WT couldn't find, and it warned.

Fix: the script now strips `//` and `/* */` comments (carefully preserving any
that appear inside string values) and tolerates trailing commas before parsing,
so the scheme upsert reliably lands in `settings.json`. A file that is still
unparsable after that is treated as genuinely corrupt and left untouched, exactly
as before. The `default` un-pin path is unchanged. Verified against a simulated
JSONC `settings.json` in the failure state (dangling pin resolved, the user's own
schemes preserved) plus unit checks for malformed-bail and string preservation.

## [2.9.0] - 2026-07-12

### Added — auto-continue after the 5-hour limit resets (opt-in, default off)

When Claude Code hits the 5-hour usage cap, the session stays alive but idle
until you come back and type something after the limit resets. Turn on the new
**Auto-continue when limit resets** toggle (folder picker, Advanced options — or
set `AUTO_CONTINUE=true` in `config.txt`) and a small background watcher does it
for you: it waits until the limit's real reset time passes, focuses this tab, and
types `continue` once so work resumes on its own.

This does **not** bypass the limit — it waits for the real reset time and then
resumes. It is conservative and capped by design:

- `AUTO_CONTINUE_MAX=5` — most times it will auto-continue in one run, then it stops.
- `AUTO_CONTINUE_FALLBACK_MIN=300` — if the limit blocks with no known reset time,
  wait this many minutes, then continue once.
- `AUTO_CONTINUE_QUIET=` — optional quiet hours `HH:MM-HH:MM` (local); never
  auto-continues inside that window.

**How detection works (recorded per gate G3):** native Windows has no wrapper
around Claude's output, so the watcher cannot read the screen. Instead
`statusline.mjs` persists the 5-hour usage %, its reset epoch, and the working
folder to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Kivun\ratelimit-<hash(cwd)>.json` each render, and the
watcher uses the **fallback heuristic** (`five_hour.pct >= 99` at the last render)
as the BLOCKED signal.

**Caveats (also in the README):**

- Resumes only: PC must be awake (not asleep), the tab still open, Claude still
  running. It does not restart a closed tab.
- The watcher briefly brings the Claude tab to the foreground at reset time to
  type `continue`; if you happen to be typing in another app at that exact moment
  the word may land there.
- Because it can't see the screen, a **permission prompt** pending at reset time
  would receive the keystrokes. The **Auto-accept file edits** chip
  (`--permission-mode acceptEdits`) helps but only auto-accepts *file-edit* prompts;
  a pending command or tool prompt still receives the keys.
- Focus targets this tab's title (the project folder name), which is the real
  Windows Terminal window title, with the static app name as a cmd.exe-fallback; it
  focuses the window but can't disambiguate multiple project tabs inside it.
- A session that blocks without a final statusline render won't auto-continue.
- **ToS:** unattended automated continuation may violate the provider's usage
  policy and can spend quota on unwanted work. Defaults are conservative; use at
  your own risk.

Files: new `source/auto-continue.js` (WSH JScript watcher, spawned detached by the
launcher), `source/statusline.mjs` (persists the state file), the launcher `.bat`,
`config.txt`, the folder picker, and the NSI installer. New `source/test/RunUT.cmd`
covers the watcher's pure logic (cscript).

## [2.8.1] - 2026-07-06

### Added — pick your terminal color in the folder picker

The picker's **Advanced options** now include a **Terminal color** control: choose
`kivun` (light blue), `dark`, `black`, `white`, keep your own Windows Terminal
theme, or type a custom hex like `#1e1e2e` — no need to hand-edit `config.txt`.
**Apply now** recolors open Windows Terminal windows immediately (and saves the
choice for future launches); the text color is picked automatically for
readability.

## [2.8.0] - 2026-07-06

### Added — pick any terminal background color

`TERMINAL_COLOR` in `config.txt` now accepts far more than the old light-blue-or-nothing:

- Named themes: `kivun` (the light blue), `dark`, `black`, `white`, and `default`
  (keep your own terminal theme, don't touch it).
- Any custom color as a hex code, e.g. `TERMINAL_COLOR=#1e1e2e`.
- The **text color is chosen automatically** — dark text on a light background, light
  text on a dark one — so every color stays readable.

The choice is applied to the Windows Terminal profile and color scheme, so it sticks for
new windows and updates an already-open window; a change takes effect on the next launch.

### Fixed — `TERMINAL_COLOR=default` now really turns the color off

Setting `TERMINAL_COLOR=default` used to leave the blue background in place, because the
color scheme was pinned into the Windows Terminal profile regardless of the setting. The
color is now owned by a single step (`apply-terminal-color.js`) that **un-pins** the scheme
for `default`, so your own terminal theme shows through — on a fresh install and on upgrade.

### Added — type `exit` to run commands, then `claude` to come back

When Claude ends, the window no longer closes. It drops to a normal command prompt in the
same tab so you can run an update, a `git` command, anything — then type **`claude`** to
return to Claude with the same language and flags, or **`exit`** to close the tab.

## [2.7.6] - 2026-06-29

### Fixed — "Continue last conversation" no longer closes the tab on a fresh folder

If you chose **Continue last** in the picker (or pinned `CLAUDE_FLAGS=--continue` in
`config.txt`) and then launched a folder with **no previous conversation**, Claude Code
printed *"No conversation found to continue"* and exited immediately — and because the whole
Windows Terminal tab is that single `claude` call, the tab closed on its own, looking like the
launcher never opened.

- `claudecode-launchpad.bat` now detects that fast failure and **automatically reopens a fresh
  Claude session** with the resume flag stripped, so you land in a working session instead of a
  vanished tab. The retry runs once; a real session you worked in and then quit lasts longer
  than the 10-second guard and is never retried. Affects `--continue`/`-c` and `--resume`/`-r`.

### Fixed — upgrading no longer wipes your `config.txt`

Previous builds rewrote `config.txt` on **every** install, silently resetting your language,
theme, `CLAUDE_FLAGS` and `STARTUP_CMD` to the wizard defaults each time you upgraded. The
installer now **only generates `config.txt` on a first install** and **preserves your existing
one on upgrade**. Your saved picker profiles (`profiles.json` — the folders/combos you saved)
were already kept across an install-over-install upgrade and remain untouched.

## [2.7.5] - 2026-06-28

### Changed — clearer "turn off all voice alerts" guidance

Documented and clarified the single **global** off switch for the voice alerts, so a
non-technical user can silence everything for good without commands:

- **README** gained a "Turn all voice alerts off" section: the on/off setting is **global**
  (every project, folder and window — *not* per-project/per-profile), takes effect
  **immediately** with no restart (the flag is re-read before every sound), and **survives
  updates/reinstalls**. Two no-command ways: the picker's **Sounds: Off**, or `Sound OFF.cmd`.
- **Picker** — the 🔊 Sound alerts help text now states plainly that it's a global, instant,
  persistent switch (not per-project).
- Corrected the stale **permission** alert row to match v2.7.4 (real tool permissions only;
  question boxes and plan approval play *waiting*).

No behavior change to the alert engine — discoverability and wording only.

## [2.7.4] - 2026-06-28

### Fixed — "permission" alert no longer fires for questions / plan approval

The voice alert wired to the `PermissionRequest` hook was playing the **"permission required"**
clip for **every** interactive prompt — including `AskUserQuestion` (multiple-choice question
boxes) and `ExitPlanMode` (plan approval), which aren't real "allow this tool?" requests. That
made it sound like permission was needed when nothing tool-related was being asked.

`play.js` now reads the hook's `tool_name` and, when a `permission` event is actually an
`AskUserQuestion` or `ExitPlanMode` prompt, plays the gentler **"waiting"** clip instead. The
**"permission"** clip now means only a genuine tool-permission request (e.g. a file edit or a
command). The hook payload is read once and reused for both reclassification and the trigger
log, so `alerts.log` records the reclassified alert while still showing the real tool.

## [2.7.3] - 2026-06-28

### Added — voice-alert controls in the folder picker

The picker now has a **🔊 Sound alerts (voice)** section (under **Advanced options**) so you
can manage the voice alerts without hunting for the `.cmd` files in `~/.claude/sounds`:

- **Sounds: On / Off**, **Voice pack: Regular / Funny**, and a **Repeat reminder** toggle
  with a minutes box (clamped to the system's 15-minute maximum).
- **▶ Test Sounds** plays the four alerts (done / permission / waiting / save) in the
  selected pack.

The controls read and write `~/.claude/sounds/config.json` directly — the same file the
alert scripts read, re-read on every play — so changes **apply immediately, no restart**.
These are **global** settings (one switch for every folder, profile and session), unlike the
per-profile options above them. Every handler is wrapped never-to-throw, and the section
hides itself with a clear note when voice alerts aren't installed yet.

## [2.7.2] - 2026-06-28

### Fixed — installer is now fully idempotent (no duplicate sound hooks)

`configure-sound-hooks.js` now treats **any** of our sound scripts as "ours" when it
de-dupes — the Node `play.js` / `reminder.js` **and** a legacy Python `notify.py` /
`reminder.py` from an earlier hand-install. Before, a machine that already had the
Python prototype wired would end up with **both** systems on every event, so each alert
played (and logged) twice. Now repeat installs — and a Python→Node switch — always
collapse to a single Node hook set.

## [2.7.1] - 2026-06-27

### Added — voice-alert trigger log (`alerts.log`)

`play.js` now records one line per alert to `alerts.log` in the sounds folder: **when**
it fired, **which** project/session triggered it, **why** (the hook event plus the tool
or idle message), and **which** `.wav` actually played. Open it with the new **View
Alert Log** launcher or `node voice.js log`.

This makes a phantom "permission" sound diagnosable at a glance — a real one logs
`event=PermissionRequest`, while a stale-session ghost (a window opened before the hooks
were wired) logs `event=Notification`. Logging never throws and self-trims to the last
2000 lines. `play.js` now also runs `main()` only when invoked directly, so requiring it
from `reminder.js` / `voice.js` no longer fires (or logs) a stray play.

## [2.7.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added — voice alerts (done / permission / waiting / save), regular or funny

Claude Code now speaks short clips so you don't have to watch the screen, each tied to
the moment that actually means it:

- **done** — on-demand; the assistant plays it when it has genuinely finished (not on
  `Stop`, which fires at the end of every turn, not at true task completion)
- **permission** — the numbered **1. Yes / 2. No** confirm appears (`PermissionRequest`,
  interactive prompts only — never auto-approved tools)
- **waiting** — Claude has been waiting on you / ~60s idle (`Notification` with
  `matcher: "idle_prompt"`, so it never fires just because a permission prompt appeared)
- **save** — manual intervention, act by hand (on-demand)

Each alert has two recordings — a plain one and a joke one. Switch with the **Regular /
Funny Sounds ON** launchers or `node voice.js mode regular|funny`; clips live under
`regular/` and `funny/` with a `funny → regular → flat` fallback. An optional repeat
reminder (off by default) re-plays the *waiting* clip every couple of minutes once
you've gone idle, disarming on `UserPromptSubmit` / `PostToolUse` (capped at 15).

Pure **Node.js** (the runtime the installer already provides) plus bundled `.wav`
clips — no Python and **no PowerShell** (Windows playback uses the Windows Media Player
COM via `cscript`, which keeps installers clear of antivirus heuristics); macOS uses
`afplay`. The installer copies `source/sounds/` (both clip sets) to `~/.claude/sounds/`
and runs `configure-sound-hooks.js`, which idempotently merges the
PermissionRequest / Notification / UserPromptSubmit / PostToolUse hooks (done and save
stay on-demand) and preserves the user's settings across upgrades. Wired into the Windows
NSIS installer, the macOS `pkg` postinstall, and the three macOS build workflows.

## [2.6.20] - 2026-06-17

### Fixed — picker no longer opens two Windows Terminal tabs per launch

Launching from the desktop icon could open **two identical tabs** for the same
folder. Instrumented logging proved the picker's `ok()` handler fired twice
~0.3s apart (a double-click on **Launch**, or Enter-plus-click after a radio had
focus), each running `claudecode-launchpad.bat READFILE` and adding its own
`wt new-tab`. `folder-picker.hta` `ok()` now carries an **idempotency guard**
(`window.__ccLaunched`): once a launch is committed, any second `ok()` returns
immediately, so at most one tab opens regardless of how the launch was triggered.
Validation failures (empty/missing folder) do not set the flag, so the user can
still correct a bad path and retry. This was **not** a Windows Terminal
`firstWindowPreference` / layout-restore issue.

### Fixed — "Download" / "release notes" buttons in the update banner did nothing

The update banner's **Download vX** and **release notes** links were silently
rejected by the `isTrustedUpdateUrl()` security allowlist. The GitHub Releases
API returns URLs with the repo's canonical casing
(`github.com/noambrand/Launchpad-CLI/...`), but the allowlist compared them
**case-sensitively** against the lower-cased `GITHUB_REPO`
(`noambrand/launchpad-cli`), so no prefix ever matched and the click was a no-op.
The comparison is now **case-insensitive** (GitHub org/repo names are
case-insensitive); the original-cased URL is still what gets opened, and the
`objects.githubusercontent.com` asset-CDN prefix is unchanged. Introduced by the
`kivun-terminal -> launchpad-cli` reference lowercasing (a5ccbdf).

### Fixed — installer now stamps the real version

`ClaudeCode_Launchpad_CLI_Setup.nsi` `PRODUCT_VERSION` was left at `2.6.18`
through the 2.6.19 release, so the installer wrote `2.6.18` to `$INSTDIR\VERSION`
and the picker's "you have vX" banner under-reported. Bumped to `2.6.20`
(`VIProductVersion` / `FileVersion` too).

## [2.6.19] - 2026-06-16

### Fixed — folder picker now applies the conversation choice (--continue / --resume) at launch

The picker's **Continue last / Pick from history** radio was shown in the flag
preview but **dropped at launch**. `composeFlagsForConfig()` deliberately keeps
`--continue` / `--resume` out of `config.txt` so a right-click "Open with..."
launch can't inherit them and crash a folder with no prior session
("No conversation found to continue") — but nothing else wrote the choice, so the
launcher's one-time-flags reader (`kivun-claude-flags.txt`) always saw an empty
file. `folder-picker.hta` now writes the choice to that one-time sidecar in `ok()`
(`writeOneTimeFlags`), which `claudecode-launchpad.bat :run_claude` applies to that
single launch then deletes; a phase-1 guard clears a stale sidecar on any
non-picker (right-click / direct) launch so it can never leak in. `config.txt`
still excludes the conversation flags. Ports the kivun-terminal-wsl v1.4.34
picker-resume fix to Launchpad's existing one-time-flags mechanism.

## [2.6.18] - 2026-06-10

### Fixed — diagnostics tool: install-log section was broken by a batch parsing bug

The v2.6.17 `launchpad-diagnostics.cmd` wrapped its install-log and Node-MSI-log
sections in an `if ... (…) else (… echo (…))` block. cmd.exe mis-parses the
parentheses *inside* the echoed text, so the compound statement errored with
"`)` was unexpected at this time" — and that parse error fires regardless of which
branch runs, which suppressed the **install-log dump** (the single most useful piece
of diagnostic data). Rewritten with plain `if exist` / `if not exist` statements (no
parenthesised blocks); the full report now generates cleanly (verified end-to-end:
all 11 sections, zero parse errors).

## [2.6.17] - 2026-06-10

### Added — one-click Diagnostics & Problem Report tool (bundled + downloadable from the release)

When something doesn't work, users can now send a complete diagnostic report in
one click instead of describing the problem from memory.

- New **`launchpad-diagnostics.cmd`**: writes `Launchpad-Report.txt` to the Desktop
  (and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Kivun`) and opens it in Notepad. It captures the Launchpad +
  Windows version, whether each launcher file is present (a **missing** one is the
  tell-tale sign antivirus removed it), Claude Code / Node / Windows Terminal /
  winget / Git detection, running antivirus, a Windows Defender quarantine hint,
  and the install log. **No admin, no PowerShell, nothing is sent automatically** —
  the user chooses whether to email it (noambbb@gmail.com) or attach it to a GitHub
  issue.
- Reachable two ways: **Start Menu → ClaudeCode Launchpad CLI → Diagnostics**, and —
  crucially — as a **standalone download on the GitHub release page**, so a user
  whose *install itself* failed (Defender quarantine, a hung step) and therefore has
  no Start-Menu shortcut can still grab the tool and report back.

### Fixed — docs no longer tell Windows users to "Run as Administrator"

The installer has been per-user (no admin) since v2.6.4, but `START_HERE.txt` and
`QUICK_START.md` still said to run it as Administrator. Corrected — double-clicking
it normally is right; admin is only ever requested by Node's own MSI if needed.

## [2.6.16] - 2026-06-10

### Fixed — Windows Defender false-positive that quarantined the launcher (app wouldn't start)

On a Windows 11 PC, Defender's machine-learning heuristic flagged
`folder-picker-launcher.wsf` as `Trojan:Script/ObfusScript.A!ml` and quarantined
it **plus the Start-Menu shortcut** — so the app couldn't launch at all. It was a
false positive, but the script *pattern* (a `wscript`-run `.wsf` that runs
`mshta` and then a hidden `.bat`) is what its ML associates with droppers.

- Removed `folder-picker-launcher.wsf` entirely. The Start-Menu/Desktop shortcuts
  now run **`mshta.exe folder-picker.hta`** directly (the picker UI itself), and
  the HTA's Launch button starts `claudecode-launchpad.bat` from within — same
  one-click UX, with no separately-launched script file for Defender's ML to flag.

### Fixed — installer hung at the Windows Terminal step on PCs that already had it

On a PC that already had Windows Terminal, `where wt.exe` didn't see it (the
App-Execution-Alias dir isn't on the installer process's PATH), so install fell
through to `winget install` — which **hung the whole installer**.

- `install.cmd` now also checks `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\WindowsApps\wt.exe`, so
  an already-installed WT is detected and skipped. When WT really is missing, the
  winget call uses `--disable-interactivity` (so it can never wait on a prompt)
  and is **optional** — it never hangs or fails the install (the launcher falls
  back to a plain console when WT is absent).

## [2.6.15] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed — removed the antivirus-flagged fallback (McAfee "terminated a suspicious app")

A fresh test PC showed McAfee blocking the install with a "Threat Blocked /
terminated a suspicious app" popup. The install log named the culprit:

```
[Claude Code] Primary download failed. Trying the built-in OS downloader...
The system cannot execute the specified program.    <- certutil terminated by McAfee
```

The `certutil -urlcache -split` fallback added in v2.6.13 is a well-known
malware download technique (a "LOLBin"), so McAfee terminates it on sight — the
fallback itself was the suspicious-looking action.

- `source/install.cmd` **no longer uses `certutil` (or any LOLBin) to download.**
  The Claude step relies on curl, which now carries the robust `.curlrc`
  (http1.1 + retry) from v2.6.14 and no longer needs a second downloader. If curl
  genuinely can't reach `claude.ai` (often AV web-protection blocking the
  domain — seen as `curl: (6) Could not resolve host: claude.ai`), it says so
  plainly and points at the manual installer instead of running a flagged tool.

### Changed — prefer Microsoft-signed winget over script-driven elevation

To stop the installer from *looking* like privilege-escalation malware:

- `source/install.cmd` now installs Node.js and Git via **winget first** —
  winget is Microsoft-signed and handles its own elevation through a trusted
  process. The official-MSI path that uses our `cscript`/`ShellExecute "runas"`
  elevation helper (`install-node-elevated.js`) is now only a fallback for PCs
  without winget, instead of the default. Same for Windows Terminal (already
  winget-only).

### Added — antivirus / SmartScreen reassurance for users

So a false-positive warning doesn't read as "this is malware":

- `README.md`, `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`, and the release-notes template now explain
  that the unsigned installer may trip SmartScreen/McAfee, why it's a false
  positive (open-source, official tools only, no LOLBin tricks), how to proceed
  (More info → Run anyway / allow `claude.ai`), and how to verify the file on
  VirusTotal. Code-signing is the durable fix and is tracked separately.

### Changed — version bump

- `ClaudeCode_Launchpad_CLI_Setup.nsi` — `PRODUCT_VERSION` 2.6.14 → 2.6.15;
  `VIProductVersion` / `FileVersion` → 2.6.15.0.
- `source/folder-picker.hta` — `FALLBACK_VERSION` → 2.6.15.
- `README.md` — badge cachebust `v2.6.14` → `v2.6.15`; picker.png alt-text bump.
- `START_HERE.txt` — banner → v2.6.15.

## [2.6.14] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed — root cause of the stalled/black Claude Code install (schannel + Anthropic's un-retried download)

v2.6.13 made *our* download retry, but a test on a clean personal PC (no
corporate proxy) showed the install still stalling on a silent black terminal,
and `claude.exe` never landing in `%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin`. Reading Anthropic's
actual installer chain (`claude.ai/install.cmd` → `bootstrap.cmd`) revealed the
true root cause:

- Windows' built-in `curl` uses the **schannel** TLS backend, which aborts large
  HTTPS downloads from Cloudflare/HTTP-2 CDNs with `(56) missing close_notify` or
  `(35) connection was reset` — it has no stream termination point and treats the
  missing TLS close as a possible truncation attack.
- Anthropic's `bootstrap.cmd` fetches the ~50 MB `claude.exe` with a **bare
  `curl -fsSL` and no retry**, so that schannel reset kills the binary download.
  We can't edit Anthropic's script.

**Fix:** `source/install.cmd` now writes a `.curlrc` (forcing `http1.1` +
`retry`/`ssl-no-revoke`) and points `CURL_HOME` at it. Forcing HTTP/1.1 gives
every response a `Content-Length` terminator, so curl never waits on
`close_notify`; the retries ride out transient resets. Because **child processes
inherit `CURL_HOME`**, Anthropic's own `curl -fsSL` picks up the same resilience
— fixing the binary download we don't control, without reimplementing it.
Verified on Windows 11 (curl 8.18.0 Schannel): the same `curl -fsSL` that failed
now completes against `downloads.claude.ai`. `CURL_HOME` is set only inside the
installer's process, so the user's own curl is unchanged afterward.

### Changed — install experience no longer looks frozen

The Claude step downloads a ~50 MB binary, but every phase's output was
redirected to the log file, so the installer console sat **black and silent** for
minutes and read as a freeze (the reported confusion).

- `source/install.cmd` now prints clean, user-facing milestones to the screen via
  a new `:say` helper (e.g. `[Claude Code] Downloading and installing Claude
  (~50 MB). This can take a minute or two — please don't close this window...`,
  then `[Claude Code] Installed.`), while the noisy curl/winget/msiexec output
  still goes only to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Kivun\install-log.txt`. Each line is written
  to both screen and log.

### Changed — version bump

- `ClaudeCode_Launchpad_CLI_Setup.nsi` — `PRODUCT_VERSION` 2.6.13 → 2.6.14;
  `VIProductVersion` / `FileVersion` → 2.6.14.0.
- `source/folder-picker.hta` — `FALLBACK_VERSION` → 2.6.14.
- `README.md` — badge cachebust `v2.6.13` → `v2.6.14`; picker.png alt-text bump.
- `START_HERE.txt` — banner → v2.6.14.

## [2.6.13] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed — Claude Code step failed on networks that break curl ("installation may have failed")

On a real test PC the installer finished Node.js fine but then popped
"Claude Code installation may have failed." The new install log
(`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Kivun\install-log.txt`) pinned the cause precisely:

```
curl: (35) Send failure: Connection was reset          <- Node download
curl: (56) schannel: server closed abruptly (missing close_notify)   <- Claude download
[ERROR] Failed to download Claude Code installer.
```

Both curl downloads were being mangled by a TLS-inspecting proxy/antivirus on
that network. Node survived because `:install_node` falls back to **winget**
(which uses the OS HTTP stack); the Claude step had **no fallback** — a single
curl failure aborted it with exit code 3, which is what the dialog reports.

- `source/install.cmd` `:install_claude` is now resilient like the Node step:
  - **curl** is retried with `--retry 3 --retry-all-errors --retry-delay 2`
    (rides out transient resets/`close_notify`) and `--ssl-no-revoke` (skips the
    CRL/OCSP checks such proxies frequently break).
  - If curl still fails, it falls back to **`certutil`**, which downloads via the
    OS HTTP stack (WinINET / system proxy) — the same path winget used
    successfully on this network. Built into every Windows; no PowerShell, no
    extra prerequisites.
  - The no-curl case now also routes through certutil instead of failing
    immediately, and the final error message points at a proxy/firewall/AV as
    the likely blocker plus the manual https://claude.ai/download link.

### Changed — version bump

- `ClaudeCode_Launchpad_CLI_Setup.nsi` — `PRODUCT_VERSION` 2.6.12 → 2.6.13;
  `VIProductVersion` / `FileVersion` → 2.6.13.0.
- `source/folder-picker.hta` — `FALLBACK_VERSION` → 2.6.13.
- `README.md` — badge cachebust `v2.6.12` → `v2.6.13`; picker.png alt-text bump.
- `START_HERE.txt` — banner → v2.6.13.

## [2.6.12] - 2026-06-03

### Fixed — Node.js install failed with exit code 1 (MSI 1603 / Error 1925)

On a clean PC the installer aborted the Node.js step with "exit code: 1". The
verbose MSI log showed the real cause:

```
Error 1925. You do not have sufficient privileges to complete this
installation for all users of the machine.
... success or error status: 1603
```

Node's official MSI installs **per-machine** (`C:\Program Files\nodejs`), which
needs elevation. The Launchpad installer deliberately runs **per-user**
(`RequestExecutionLevel user`, since v2.6.4), so calling `msiexec /qn`
non-elevated could never succeed — it returned 1603 and `install.cmd` exited 1.

- New `source/install-node-elevated.js`: installs the Node MSI via a single UAC
  elevation prompt (`ShellExecute "runas"`), staying silent (`/qn /norestart`)
  and writing a verbose MSI log. It captures the real msiexec exit code through
  a sentinel file (absolute, invoking-user path, so it also works under
  over-the-shoulder UAC) and reports a distinct code when the user declines the
  prompt. The rest of the installer stays per-user — only msiexec elevates, and
  Node's install location does not depend on which account approves UAC.
- `source/install.cmd` `:install_node` now calls the helper instead of a bare
  `msiexec /qn`, and surfaces the failure code and log path on error.
- `source/install.cmd` now appends every phase's output to
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Kivun\install-log.txt`, and the Node MSI verbose log to
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Kivun\node-msi.log`, so a failed install always leaves
  evidence on disk (previously nothing was logged — NSI runs the script with a
  hidden console).
- `ClaudeCode_Launchpad_CLI_Setup.nsi`: bundles the new helper and, on Node
  failure, points the user at both log files and reminds them to approve the
  UAC prompt.

### Fixed — Claude Code step failed with "'curl.exe' is not recognized"

Exposed by the new install log on a real test PC: the Node.js step now succeeds,
but the Claude Code step then failed to download because `curl.exe` was suddenly
"not recognized" — even though curl had just worked for the Node download.

Root cause: `:refresh_path` **replaced** `PATH` with the raw registry `Path`
values. The system `Path` is a `REG_EXPAND_SZ`, and `reg query` returns it
**unexpanded** (literal `%SystemRoot%\system32;...`). cmd doesn't re-expand
those, so `C:\Windows\System32` effectively fell off `PATH` and `curl.exe` /
`where.exe` stopped resolving. The Node step was unaffected only because it uses
curl *before* the first `refresh_path`; the Claude step calls `refresh_path`
first.

- `source/install.cmd` `:refresh_path` now **appends** the registry entries to
  the existing (correctly expanded) `PATH` instead of replacing it — System32
  stays, and newly-installed dirs (e.g. `C:\Program Files\nodejs`, stored
  literally) are still picked up.

### Fixed — launcher falsely reported "Claude Code not found" right after install

On the same test PC, Claude's native installer placed `claude.exe` in
`%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin` and noted that dir "is not in your PATH" yet. The
launcher's `where claude` check would then fail and abort with
"Claude Code not found" (plus outdated `npm install` advice) even though Claude
was installed — because a shortcut-spawned shell keeps the old PATH until the
user logs out/in.

- `source/claudecode-launchpad.bat`: adds `%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin` to `PATH`
  (when `claude.exe` is there) at the top of the script, so both the initial
  launch and the Windows Terminal relaunch find Claude immediately — no reboot
  required. Also corrected the not-found message (point to the installer /
  claude.ai/download and the log-out/in hint, not `npm`).

### Changed — version bump

- `ClaudeCode_Launchpad_CLI_Setup.nsi` — `PRODUCT_VERSION` 2.6.11 → 2.6.12;
  `VIProductVersion` / `FileVersion` → 2.6.12.0.
- `source/folder-picker.hta` — `FALLBACK_VERSION` → 2.6.12.
- `README.md` — badge cachebust `v2.6.11` → `v2.6.12`; picker.png alt-text bump.
- `START_HERE.txt` — banner → v2.6.12.

## [2.6.11] - 2026-05-27

### Fixed — picker always opens with Opus as the default model

The Default profile now never persists the model selection. Previously, if a
user launched with Sonnet, the Default profile saved `model: "sonnet"` and the
picker would silently open on Sonnet next time — even though the user never
asked for Sonnet to be the permanent default.

- `captureDialogToProfile`: when saving the Default profile, always writes
  `"opus"` for the model field regardless of what was selected at Launch time.
- `applyProfileToDialog`: when loading the Default profile, always sets the
  model radio to Opus regardless of what is stored.
- Named project profiles are unaffected and continue to remember their own
  model as an explicit per-project choice.
- Applied to both `source/folder-picker.hta` (Windows) and
  `kivun-terminal-wsl/payload/folder-picker.hta` (WSL).

### Changed — version bump

- `ClaudeCode_Launchpad_CLI_Setup.nsi` — `PRODUCT_VERSION` 2.6.10 → 2.6.11;
  `VIProductVersion` / `FileVersion` → 2.6.11.0.
- `source/folder-picker.hta` — `FALLBACK_VERSION` → 2.6.11.
- `README.md` — badge cachebusts `v2.6.10` → `v2.6.11`; picker.png alt-text bump.
- `START_HERE.txt` — banner → v2.6.11.

## [2.6.10] - 2026-05-26

### Fixed — picker model selection now reliably honors Sonnet/Haiku

Selecting a non-default model (Sonnet/Haiku) in the picker's Advanced section
could silently launch Opus anyway. The model `<label>` radios were implicitly
associated with their `<input>` (no `for`/`id`), so under HTA's IE engine,
clicking the label *text* (e.g. "Sonnet") did not check the underlying radio —
`getRadioValue()` still returned the previously-checked `opus`, which is what
got written to `config.txt` and launched.

- `source/folder-picker.hta`: each model radio now has an explicit `id` with a
  matching `<label for>`, plus an `onclick` that force-checks the radio via
  `setRadioValue('flag-model', <value>)`. Clicking either the circle or the
  label text now registers the choice. No behavior change to the default
  (Opus remains the default); only deliberate picks are affected.

### Changed — version bump

- `ClaudeCode_Launchpad_CLI_Setup.nsi` — `PRODUCT_VERSION` 2.6.9 → 2.6.10;
  `VIProductVersion` / `FileVersion` → 2.6.10.0.
- `source/folder-picker.hta` — `FALLBACK_VERSION` → 2.6.10.
- `README.md` — badge cachebusts `v2.6.9` → `v2.6.10`; picker.png alt-text bump.
- `START_HERE.txt` — banner → v2.6.10.

## [2.6.9] - 2026-05-26

### Added — open new projects as tabs in one window, named by project

Launching ClaudeCode Launchpad always opened a brand-new Windows Terminal
window. Now a second (and every later) launch opens a **new tab** in the same
window, so you can work on multiple projects side by side.

- `source/claudecode-launchpad.bat`: the Windows Terminal launch now targets a
  named window — `wt.exe -w "ClaudeCodeLaunchpad" --maximized new-tab …` — so
  the first launch creates the window and subsequent launches add tabs to it.
  (`--maximized` only applies when the window is first created.)
- **Each tab is named by its project folder** (e.g. `gvSIG`). The launcher
  computes the folder basename and passes it as `--title`.
- `suppressApplicationTitle: true` is now set on the `ClaudeCode Launchpad CLI`
  Windows Terminal profile so Claude can't overwrite the tab title with its own
  "Claude Code". Applied in both WT fragments and `source/apply-wt-settings.js`,
  which also removes the old static `tabTitle` so the per-tab `--title` wins.

### Release sweep

- `ClaudeCode_Launchpad_CLI_Setup.nsi` — `PRODUCT_VERSION` 2.6.8 → 2.6.9;
  `VIProductVersion` / `FileVersion` → 2.6.9.0.
- `source/folder-picker.hta` — `FALLBACK_VERSION` → 2.6.9.
- `README.md` — badge cachebusts `v2.6.8` → `v2.6.9`; picker.png alt-text bump.
- `START_HERE.txt` — version bumped.

## [2.6.8] - 2026-05-25

### Hardened — upgrades no longer leave a stale "update available" banner

After installing a new build, a launcher window left open from the *previous*
build kept showing the old version's `🆕 Update available` banner (e.g. "you
have v2.6.6" right after installing v2.6.7). The launcher is an HTA hosted by
`mshta.exe`; it loads into memory and runs its GitHub update check only **once**
at window load, so an already-open window never re-checks against the newly
installed files. The on-disk install was correct — the open window was just
running old code.

Two belt-and-suspenders fixes:

- **Installer now closes running launcher windows before overwriting files.**
  New `source/close-launchers.js` (pure WSH + WMI, no PowerShell) terminates
  any `mshta.exe` whose command line references `folder-picker.hta` — targeted,
  so unrelated mshta windows and this product's own `fix-wt-icon.hta` are left
  alone. Run from the temp plugins dir at the start of `SecCore` (so it works
  even before `$INSTDIR` is touched, and on first installs) and again at the
  start of uninstall so `RMDir` isn't blocked by an open window. Best-effort:
  any failure is swallowed and never blocks the install.
- **Installer now writes `$INSTDIR\VERSION` as the single source of truth.**
  `readInstalledVersion()` already preferred this file and only fell back to the
  HTA's hardcoded `FALLBACK_VERSION` when it was absent — but nothing ever wrote
  it, so the self-reported "you have vX" figure depended entirely on the HTA
  constant being bumped. The figure now always matches what was actually
  installed.

### Docs

- `docs/QUICK_START.md` — added a "Pin it to your taskbar (Windows)" section, mirroring the installer finish-page tip, so the one-click blue icon is discoverable.

### Release sweep

- `ClaudeCode_Launchpad_CLI_Setup.nsi` — `PRODUCT_VERSION` 2.6.7 → 2.6.8;
  `VIProductVersion` / `FileVersion` → 2.6.8.0; ships `close-launchers.js`;
  writes `VERSION`; closes launchers on install + uninstall.
- `source/folder-picker.hta` — `FALLBACK_VERSION` → 2.6.8.
- `README.md` — badge cachebusts `v2.6.7` → `v2.6.8`; picker.png alt-text bump.
- `START_HERE.txt` — version bumped.

## [2.6.7] - 2026-05-25

### Fixed — Launchpad profile could open a bare cmd.exe instead of Claude

On a machine where the ClaudeCode Launchpad profile had been *materialized* into Windows Terminal's `settings.json` (`source: ClaudeCodeLaunchpad`), the materialized entry could end up with **no `commandline` key**. Windows Terminal then fell back to the global `defaultProfile` (Command Prompt), so the window opened a bare `cmd` shell **without Claude**. The same profile had also had its keys **duplicated 4×** by the legacy string-splicing `apply-wt-settings.js` (the duplication noted in the v2.6.6 follow-ups below).

- Repair: a materialized `ClaudeCodeLaunchpad` profile now always carries `"commandline": "cmd /c claude"`, and duplicate keys are collapsed to a single set.
- A leftover window restored by `"firstWindowPreference": "persistedWindowLayout"` can make this present as *"two windows open, one without Claude"* — closing all Windows Terminal windows once clears the restored layout.

### Changed — `source/apply-wt-settings.js` rewritten to parse real JSON (was string-splicing)

The previous version edited `settings.json` by raw string insertion. Its only idempotency guard was a text search for `"colorScheme"`, so repeated installs appended the same keys again and again (the 4× duplication above) and it never wrote a `commandline`. Rewritten to:

- `JSON.parse` → mutate the object → `JSON.stringify` — inherently idempotent, and collapses any pre-existing duplicate keys;
- always set `"commandline": "cmd /c claude"` on the materialized profile;
- strip a UTF-8 BOM before parsing and write UTF-8 (no BOM), the encoding Windows Terminal expects;
- back up `settings.json` first and **bail without writing** if the file can't be parsed (e.g. hand-edited JSONC), so a malformed file is never clobbered.

### Note — `fix-wt-icon.hta` tooling now actually committed

The v2.6.6 entry described `source/fix-wt-icon.hta` + `source/FIX_WT_ICON_README.txt`, but those files were never committed with that release. They are included here.

### Release sweep

- `ClaudeCode_Launchpad_CLI_Setup.nsi` — `PRODUCT_VERSION` 2.6.6 → 2.6.7; `VIProductVersion` / `FileVersion` → 2.6.7.0.
- `README.md` — badge cachebust `v2.6.6` → `v2.6.7`; picker.png alt-text version bump.
- `START_HERE.txt`, `source/folder-picker.hta` (`FALLBACK_VERSION`) — version bumped.

## [2.6.6] - 2026-05-24

### Fixed — Windows Terminal tab/taskbar icon (broken since v2.2.0)

The Windows Terminal profile pointed its `icon` at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Kivun\claude_code.ico`, but v2.2.0 renamed the shipped icon to `claude_icon.ico` and updated everything **except** the two WT fragment files. Since then Windows Terminal has been pointing at a non-existent file, so the Launchpad profile showed the wrong/stale icon on the tab and no Kivun icon on the taskbar when minimized (on machines upgraded from a pre-v2.2.0 install, a leftover `claude_code.ico` made the tab show the *old* icon).

- `source/claudecode-launchpad-wt-fragment.json` and `source/claudecode-launchpad-wt-fragment-nocolor.json`: `icon` now references `claude_icon.ico` (the file the installer actually ships), matching the shortcut, Add/Remove Programs, and context-menu entries which were already correct.

No other behavior change. Users upgrading should close all Windows Terminal windows and relaunch so WT reloads the fragment; a leftover `claude_code.ico` from a very old install can be deleted.

> **Follow-up (2026-05-24): the fragment fix alone does not repair already-customized machines.** On a machine where the Launchpad profile was customized, WT materializes it into `settings.json` (`source: ClaudeCodeLaunchpad`) and that entry can shadow the fragment. On at least one upgraded machine the materialized profile also had its keys duplicated 4× (legacy `apply-wt-settings.js` appending on every install) and **no explicit `icon` key**, so the icon fell back to the generic WT icon. First manual fix: open `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\settings.json`, find the `ClaudeCodeLaunchpad` profile, remove the duplicated keys, add an `"icon"`, save, then fully close and relaunch WT (all windows).
>
> **Follow-up 2 (2026-05-24): the tab icon and the taskbar/window icon are loaded by *different* code paths in WT, and only the tab path is robust.** After adding the `icon` key above, the **tab** showed the Kivun icon correctly but the **taskbar button stayed generic** — even with the launch working directory and the icon both on `C:`. This is upstream bug [microsoft/terminal#16233](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/16233) (open, Priority-3): WT's window/taskbar icon loader is fragile about local `.ico` references and silently fails to render them while the tab loader succeeds. Confirmed *not* the cause on this machine: icon file is valid (16/32/48/64 px, 32bpp) and on the same drive as the launch dir. Suspected remaining trigger: the window-icon loader not resolving the `%LOCALAPPDATA%` environment variable that the tab loader resolves fine. **Current mitigation:** the profile `icon` was changed from `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Kivun\\claude_icon.ico` to a **literal absolute path** (`C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\Kivun\\claude_icon.ico`) on the same drive as the launch directory. Per #16233 the only *fully* reliable taskbar icons are same-drive literal paths or built-in `ms-appx:` icons; cross-drive paths and `https:` URLs are confirmed to fail. The installer should write the expanded literal path into the fragment at install time (the fragment can't carry a per-user absolute path); tracked as a follow-up.

### Added — `fix-wt-icon.hta` automated repair tool (+ two HTA bugs fixed during testing)

New `source/fix-wt-icon.hta` automates the manual `settings.json` repair above: backs up the file, locates the `ClaudeCodeLaunchpad` profile, sets `"icon"` to the **expanded literal absolute path** (`%LOCALAPPDATA%` resolved at runtime via `ExpandEnvironmentStrings`, e.g. `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Kivun\claude_icon.ico`) per Follow-up 2 above, and saves. Companion `source/FIX_WT_ICON_README.txt` documents both the automated and manual paths. No PowerShell — runs via `mshta.exe` ([[no-powershell]] project rule).

Two bugs surfaced and were fixed while testing the tool on a live machine:

- **`'JSON' is undefined`** — `mshta.exe` renders in IE7 document mode by default, where the native `JSON` object (IE8+ standards mode) does not exist, so `JSON.parse` threw. Fixed by adding `<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">` as the first `<head>` element, forcing the modern IE11 script engine — matching the already-working `source/folder-picker.hta`.
- **`Invalid character`** — the file was read with `OpenTextFile(..., -1)` (UTF-16) and written with `CreateTextFile(..., true)` (UTF-16), but Windows Terminal stores `settings.json` as **UTF-8 (no BOM)**. Reading UTF-8 bytes as UTF-16 mangled the text and broke `JSON.parse`; the write path would have corrupted the file. Replaced both with `ADODB.Stream`-based `readUtf8()` / `writeUtf8NoBom()` helpers, again mirroring `folder-picker.hta`. The backup-before-write step meant no settings files were harmed by the failed runs.

### Fixed — no longer deletes the sister Kivun Terminal (WSL) product's shortcut + right-click menu

This installer used to treat `Kivun Terminal` as its own former name and, on every install/uninstall, delete `$DESKTOP\Kivun Terminal.lnk`, `$SMPROGRAMS\Kivun Terminal`, and the `KivunTerminal` folder context-menu keys. Those now belong to a **separate, still-installed product** — the WSL-based Kivun Terminal (`noambrand/kivun-terminal-wsl`) — so this was wiping that product's desktop shortcut and "Open with Kivun Terminal" menu whenever this installer ran. Removed that cleanup from `SecCore`, the uninstaller, and the finish-page shortcut function. The two products now coexist: this one owns the `ClaudeCodeLaunchpad` namespace, the other owns `KivunTerminal`. (This installer still cleans up its *own* legacy `Kivun` ARP entry and Windows Terminal fragment.)

### Changed — finish-page checkboxes default to unchecked

"Create Desktop Shortcut" and "View Quick Start Guide" on the installer's finish page are now unchecked by default (`MUI_FINISHPAGE_RUN_NOTCHECKED`, `MUI_FINISHPAGE_SHOWREADME_NOTCHECKED`).

## [2.6.5] - 2026-05-18

### Added — statusline reasoning-effort field + opt-in extras

The bottom-of-session statusline (`source/statusline.mjs`, internal version bumped v2.1 → v2.2) now surfaces the reasoning effort level (low/medium/high/max) that Claude Code 2.1.x supports via `/effort`. Inspired by [jftuga/claude-statusline](https://github.com/jftuga/claude-statusline), which also exposes session cost, cache tokens, and tokens/minute — those land here as **opt-in** fields so the bar stays clean for users who don't want them.

#### `source/statusline.mjs`

- **New default field `effort:<level>` on line 1**, magenta, placed right after the model name. Three-tier resolution chain in `readEffort()`:
  1. `d.effort.level` from the JSON Claude Code pipes to the statusline. Forward-compat for [anthropics/claude-code#40261](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/40261) (request to expose effort on the statusline payload) — still open as of 2026-05, also tracked under #38476, #31415, #27747.
  2. `CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL` env var. Useful as an explicit override per shell.
  3. `effortLevel` key from `~/.claude/settings.json`. Picks up the user's saved default. **Known gap:** stale on mid-session `/effort` overrides — Claude Code doesn't rewrite `settings.json` when the user toggles effort during a session, so the statusline will show whatever was set at session start. Upstream limitation; no workaround until Anthropic ships #40261.

  If none of the three resolve, the field is hidden (cleaner than rendering a misleading `auto` placeholder).

- **Three opt-in fields, off by default** — each gated by a single env var matched by `truthy()` (`1`/`true`/`yes`/`on`):
  - `KIVUN_SL_COST=1` — renders `$X.XX` from `d.cost.total_cost_usd` in green.
  - `KIVUN_SL_CACHE=1` — renders `cache:<N>` (sum of `cache_read_input_tokens` + `cache_creation_input_tokens`, formatted as M/K/raw) in blue.
  - `KIVUN_SL_TPM=1` — renders `tpm:<output_tokens_per_minute>` in cyan, suppressed when session duration is under 5 s.
- **No installer changes.** Env vars beat installer-controlled flags here because adding new keys would have meant touching `ClaudeCode_Launchpad_CLI_Setup.nsi` and the macOS `.pkg` postinstall scripts. Env vars require touching neither — `setx KIVUN_SL_COST 1` on Windows or `export KIVUN_SL_COST=1` in shell rc on macOS, and the field appears. Trade-off: less discoverable; documented in `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` to compensate.
- **Imports added:** `fs`, `path`, `os` (needed for the `settings.json` fallback read). First time the file has imports.

#### Release sweep

- `ClaudeCode_Launchpad_CLI_Setup.nsi` — `PRODUCT_VERSION` 2.6.4 → 2.6.5; `VIProductVersion` and `FileVersion` → 2.6.5.0.
- `README.md` — cachebust `cb=v2.6.4` → `v2.6.5` (both badges); picker.png alt text version bumped.
- `source/folder-picker.hta` — `FALLBACK_VERSION = "2.6.4"` → `"2.6.5"`.
- `START_HERE.txt` — banner version bumped.
- `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` — new section documenting the four statusline env vars (`CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL`, `KIVUN_SL_COST`, `KIVUN_SL_CACHE`, `KIVUN_SL_TPM`).

#### Sister repo

Same statusline change shipped same day in `noambrand/kivun-terminal-wsl` as Kivun Terminal v1.4.10.

## [2.6.4] - 2026-05-08

### Security fixes from internal audit

A security audit of the v2.6.3 codebase surfaced three HIGH-severity issues — one in the NSIS installer, two in the picker. All fixed in this release.

#### Fixed (HIGH)

- **`ClaudeCode_Launchpad_CLI_Setup.nsi` — installer no longer requests admin elevation (audit #1).** v2.6.3 and earlier shipped with `RequestExecutionLevel admin` while writing per-user files into `$LOCALAPPDATA\Kivun` and the right-click context menu into `HKLM`/`HKCR`. Under "over-the-shoulder" UAC (a regular user enters an admin's password), `$LOCALAPPDATA` resolves to the **admin's** profile, not the invoking user — so the desktop shortcut, picker, and Windows Terminal fragment land where the real user can't reach them. Fixed: `RequestExecutionLevel user`; uninstaller entry moved from `HKLM` to `HKCU`; right-click context menu moved from `HKCR Directory\shell\...` to `HKCU Software\Classes\Directory\shell\...`; `CLAUDE_CODE_STATUSLINE` env var moved from `HKLM SYSTEM\...\Environment` to `HKCU\Environment`. Uninstaller also best-effort cleans the legacy HKLM/HKCR locations from v2.6.3-and-older admin installs (silently no-ops without admin, which is fine).
- **`source/folder-picker.hta` — JScript injection via profile chip onclick (audit #2).** v2.6.0–v2.6.3's `populateProfileChips()` HTML-escaped profile names with `&#39;` for the single quote, then interpolated them into `onclick="switchToProfile('NAME')"`. IE/HTA HTML-decodes attributes **before** evaluating the JS, so `&#39;` becomes `'` again and a profile name like `x'); evil(); //` survives the escape and runs as JScript with full ActiveX privileges. Fixed by passing a profile **index** (a literal integer, no interpolation risk) and looking up the name from trusted state inside a new `switchToProfileByIndex()` handler.
- **`source/folder-picker.hta` — `WshShell.Run` trusted attacker-controllable URL in update banner (audit #3).** v2.6.1's update-check feature interpolated GitHub's `browser_download_url` into `onclick="openUpdateUrl('URL')"`. Two layers of risk: (a) `escapeHtml` did not escape `'`, so a hostile JSON response with `'` in the URL could break out of the JS string; (b) under a corp-MITM root CA, the JSON itself can be rewritten to point `browser_download_url` at any URL and ride the user's click into arbitrary download/run. Fixed two ways: (1) URLs stashed in module-scope `__pendingReleaseUrl`/`__pendingDownloadUrl` read by parameter-less click handlers — no string interpolation; (2) new `isTrustedUpdateUrl()` allowlists the URL prefix to `https://github.com/noambrand/kivun-terminal/`, `https://api.github.com/repos/noambrand/kivun-terminal/`, and `https://objects.githubusercontent.com/`; anything else is silently rejected.

#### Not fixed in this release (deferred)

- **MEDIUM #4 — `KIVUN_CLAUDE_BIN` env validation.** Applies to the WSL sister repo only (this repo doesn't ship the BiDi wrapper). N/A here.
- **MEDIUM #5 — synchronous WinHttp call hangs picker UI ≤ 5 s on hostile networks.** Marked as known limitation; async rewrite isn't worth destabilising a working feature.
- **MEDIUM #6 — quote injection if `installDir` contains `"` or `&`.** Theoretical; NTFS forbids `"` in paths.

#### Confirmed clean (negative findings)

- ✅ No hardcoded secrets in source
- ✅ Bash and batch launchers correctly quote user paths
- ✅ No DLL search-order hijacking opportunities
- ✅ NSIS uninstaller `RMDir /r` is path-bounded — can't be tricked into root delete
- ✅ `data.tag_name` from GitHub API is `escapeHtml`'d before innerHTML


## [2.6.3] - 2026-05-08

### Doc/version consistency sweep across bundled .txt files

User feedback: *"the txt has the old version noted, all txt should have the updated txt version number to prevent confusion. every release needs to check consistency for all documents and github notes on read me and release notes."*

- **`START_HERE.txt`** — header banner bumped from `ClaudeCode Launchpad CLI v2.0.1` to `v2.6.3`. The file ships inside the installer (visible to first-time users opening the install dir), so a stale "v2.0.1" header was misleading them.
- **`README.md`** — version cachebust query `cb=v2.6.2` → `v2.6.3` so shields.io re-fetches version + downloads badges.
- **`source/folder-picker.hta`** — `FALLBACK_VERSION = "2.6.2"` → `"2.6.3"`.
- **`ClaudeCode_Launchpad_CLI_Setup.nsi`** — `PRODUCT_VERSION` 2.6.2 → 2.6.3; `VIProductVersion` and `FileVersion` → 2.6.3.0.

### Process change

Going forward: every release scans `git ls-files` for stale version refs (any `v2.X.Y` older than the upcoming tag) in `*.txt` and `*.md` files BEFORE the tag is pushed. CI doesn't enforce this yet — it's a manual checklist item until a workflow validates it. The reason this slipped on v2.6.2: I bumped `.nsi PRODUCT_VERSION` and `docs/CHANGELOG.md` at release time but never grep'd the rest of the tree.


## [2.6.2] - 2026-05-08

### Update-available banner in the picker + table fixes + bigger collapsed window

User feedback after v2.6.1: comparison-table parenthetical in the README was missing `+ startup slash-commands` (the WSL sister repo had the full feature list, this one was clipped), and the picker should detect when a newer release is available and offer one-click download.

- **`source/folder-picker.hta`** — new yellow banner at the top of the picker (above the profile chip row) that reads *"🆕 Update available: vX.Y.Z (you have vA.B.C) — release notes — [Download vX.Y.Z]"*. Banner appears only when `compareVersions(latestTag, installed) > 0`. Hidden by default; rendered only after a successful API check. Has a `✕` dismiss button (hides until next launch) and a "release notes" link to the GitHub release page. The `Download` button shells out via `WSHShell.Run` to the asset URL — opens in the user's default browser, which starts downloading `ClaudeCode_Launchpad_CLI_Setup.exe` immediately.
- **`source/folder-picker.hta`** — new helpers: `readInstalledVersion()` (reads `installDir\VERSION`, falls back to a hardcoded `FALLBACK_VERSION = "2.6.2"` since this repo's `.nsi` doesn't yet write the file at install time); `compareVersions(a, b)` (numeric tuple compare); `checkForUpdate()` (synchronous `WinHttp.WinHttpRequest.5.1` GET against `https://api.github.com/repos/noambrand/kivun-terminal/releases/latest` with 5 s timeouts, picks the asset matching `/^ClaudeCode_Launchpad_CLI_Setup\.exe$/i`). All errors swallowed silently. The check is deferred via `setTimeout(checkForUpdate, 100)` from `init()` so the picker renders before the sync HTTP call blocks the UI thread.
- **`source/folder-picker.hta`** — collapsed-window height bumped from 615 px to 690 px so the optional update-banner fits without triggering scrollbars when shown.
- **`README.md`** — comparison table parentheticals at lines 48 and 61 updated from `(folder + model + flags + env vars)` to `(folder + model + flags + env vars + startup slash-commands)` to match the actual feature list and the WSL sister repo's table.
- **`ClaudeCode_Launchpad_CLI_Setup.nsi`** — `PRODUCT_VERSION` 2.6.1 → 2.6.2; `VIProductVersion` and `FileVersion` → 2.6.2.0.

### Why FALLBACK_VERSION exists

The picker reads `VERSION` from `installDir` to know what's installed. This `.nsi` doesn't currently write a `VERSION` file at install time (unlike the kivun-terminal-wsl sister), so on every install `readInstalledVersion()` falls back to the constant baked into the HTA. That means the "you have vX.Y.Z" line in the banner reflects the **picker's** version, not the original installer's — close enough until the .nsi grows a `FileWrite "${INSTDIR}\VERSION" "${PRODUCT_VERSION}"` line in a follow-up.


## [2.6.1] - 2026-05-07

### Collapse Advanced section in picker + fix sticky `--continue` bug

User feedback after v2.6.0: the picker's five-section layout (model / flags / startup-cmds / env-vars on top of folder selection) was overwhelming for first-time users, and a separate report that right-clicking a folder via the desktop shortcut crashed Claude with `No conversation found to continue` even when the user hadn't asked for `--continue`.

- **`source/folder-picker.hta`** — sections 3 (Claude flags), 4 (startup slash commands), 5 (environment variables) wrapped in a collapsible `<div id="advanced-body">` toggled by a single button labelled `▶ Advanced options — click to show model, flags, startup slash commands, env vars`. Default state is collapsed regardless of profile content. Window opens at a compact 615 px and grows to fit content when the toggle is clicked (`autoSizeToContent` switches between fixed 615 px collapsed and dynamic `scrollHeight + 60` expanded; HTA's scrollHeight measurement is unreliable when content is `display:none`, so the collapsed branch hardcodes the value rather than measuring).
- **`source/folder-picker.hta`** — new `composeFlagsForConfig()` helper used in the `writeFlagsToConfig` call. It excludes `--continue` and `--resume` (the two values from the `flag-conv` radio group). `composeFlags()` still includes them for the live preview and the actual launch. The reason: right-click "Open with ClaudeCode Launchpad CLI" reads `CLAUDE_FLAGS` from `config.txt` and runs `claude` with those flags in the chosen folder; if a previous picker session set `flag-conv=Continue last`, the resulting `CLAUDE_FLAGS=--continue` line poisoned every right-click launch on a folder with no prior session. Conversation flags are now per-launch only — they affect the current click but never become sticky.
- **`ClaudeCode_Launchpad_CLI_Setup.nsi`** — `PRODUCT_VERSION` 2.6.0 → 2.6.1; `VIProductVersion` and `FileVersion` → 2.6.1.0.


## [2.6.0] - 2026-05-06

### Named profiles + per-profile env vars (parity with kivun-terminal-wsl v1.4.x)

The picker dialog grows a **profile bar** (chip row) at the top so users with multiple projects can save folder + model + flags + startup commands + env vars as named combos and switch between them with one click. Direct port of the v1.4.x feature from the kivun-terminal-wsl sibling, adapted for Launchpad CLI's no-WSL-boundary architecture.

#### Added

- **`source/folder-picker.hta`** — top-of-dialog profile chip row (one chip per saved profile, active highlighted blue). `+ New` saves the current dialog state as a new named profile; `Rename` and `Delete` manage existing ones (Default is undeletable, auto-rebuilds from `config.txt` if `profiles.json` is missing). New §5 for `KEY=VAL` environment variables (one per line, `#` comments allowed, KEY validated as `[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*`). Resolved-command preview rebuilt: shows the full `$ claude <flags>` line plus secondary lines for startup-cmds and env-vars (`↳ then types: …`, `↳ with env (masked): KEY=…(set), …`). Env values **masked by default** for screenshot safety; `👁 show values` toggle reveals them. Profiles persist to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Kivun\profiles.json`.
- **`source/claudecode-launchpad.bat`** — env-var loading block before the `claude` invocation. Reads `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Kivun\kivun-env.txt` (written by the picker on Launch) and `set`s each `KEY=VAL` in cmd scope. Unlike kivun-terminal-wsl, **no `WSLENV` plumbing needed** — Launchpad CLI runs natively on Windows so cmd-set env vars reach the spawned `claude` process directly.

#### Changed

- **`source/folder-picker.hta`** — chip rendering uses `innerHTML` with inline `onclick` attributes instead of `createElement + .onclick` (the latter is unreliable for dynamically-created HTA elements; the former works because IE parses the attribute string into a real handler at render time).
- **`source/folder-picker.hta`** — `+ Low effort` chip removed from the flag-chip palette. `+ High effort` remains. Existing profiles get `--effort low` auto-scrubbed from `customFlags` on load via `scrubDeprecatedFlags()` (persisted so the scrub runs once).
- **`source/folder-picker.hta`** — Custom flags textbox `placeholder` attribute emptied per user feedback.
- **`README.md`** — both compare tables get a new "Named profiles per project" row. Picker bullet copy updated to lead with profiles. Version + downloads badge URLs gain `&cb=v2.6.0` cachebust so GitHub camo refetches fresh SVGs immediately.
- **`ClaudeCode_Launchpad_CLI_Setup.nsi`** — `PRODUCT_VERSION` 2.5.0 → 2.6.0; `VIProductVersion` and `FileVersion` → 2.6.0.0.

#### Compatibility

- `profiles.json` is created on first run from the existing `CLAUDE_FLAGS=` line in `config.txt`. No data lost; existing pinned flags become the Default profile.
- macOS port of the profile feature is not in v2.6.0; the .pkg installer continues to ship the v2.5.0-equivalent picker. Mac parity is on the v2.7.x roadmap.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-05-06

### Folder picker dialog overhaul

Replaces the old single-purpose BrowseForFolder picker with a unified HTA dialog that combines path selection, model + flag selection, and startup commands into one window — parity with the kivun-terminal-wsl sibling.

#### Added

- **`source/folder-picker.hta`** — single dialog with four sections:
  1. Type or paste a Windows path
  2. Browse Folder Tree (native dialog still available)
  3. Claude flags (optional): model radio buttons (Opus default / Sonnet / Haiku / Let Claude decide), conversation radios (Start fresh / `--continue` / `--resume`), 10 simple-user chip buttons (Respond in Hebrew, Low effort, High effort, Concise responses, Step-by-step reasoning, Always include tests, Auto-accept file edits, Read-only, Don't fail if Opus is busy, Confirm before changes), free-text Custom field, live "Effective:" preview
  4. Startup slash commands textarea — multi-line support, each line typed into Claude after the TUI loads
- **`source/folder-picker-launcher.wsf`** rewritten — invokes `mshta.exe` on the HTA, terminates cleanly if the user cancels (no `%USERPROFILE%` fallback that looks like a phantom launch).
- **`source/inject-startup-cmd.js`** — handles multi-line startup commands; types each line + Enter with an inter-command delay so Claude registers each as a separate slash command.
- **`source/save-defaults.js`**, **`source/write-startcmd.js`** — UTF-8-safe helpers; `save-defaults.js` rewrites `config.txt` in place, preserving comments and other keys.
- **`STARTUP_CMD`** in `config.txt` for persistent default.

#### Removed

- **`source/folder-picker.wsf`** — superseded by the HTA, which has Browse, type-path, and flag selection in one window. The native `BrowseForFolder` dialog is still callable from inside the HTA via the **Browse Folder Tree** button.
- **`source/claudecode-launchpad-choose-folder.bat`** — the text-input + flag-prompts + save-as-default flow it implemented now lives inside the HTA, with no cmd-window prompts.

#### Changed

- **`source/claudecode-launchpad.bat`** — reads `STARTUP_CMD` from `config.txt`, spawns `inject-startup-cmd.js` when a startcmd file is queued, comments updated to reference the HTA picker.
- **NSI installer** — ships the HTA + helpers, no longer the deleted `folder-picker.wsf` or `choose-folder.bat`. Pre-install dialog warns users to close active CLI sessions before upgrading.
- **README.md** — `picker.png` screenshot at top showing the new dialog.

## [2.4.1] - 2026-04-12

### Security Fixes - IMPORTANT UPDATE

**macOS users should update immediately.** This release fixes critical security vulnerabilities in the macOS installer.

#### Fixed Vulnerabilities

1. **Command Injection via Configuration File** (Critical - CVE pending)
   - **Risk**: Malicious code execution if config.txt is modified
   - **Fix**: Removed `eval` usage, implemented proper argument passing
   - **Affected**: macOS installer v2.4.0 only
   - **Impact**: Desktop shortcut and Finder Quick Action now safely handle user-provided flags

2. **Privilege Escalation via Temporary Sudo** (High)
   - **Risk**: Passwordless sudo could persist if installer is interrupted
   - **Fix**: Added trap handler to ensure cleanup even on crash/Ctrl+C
   - **Affected**: macOS installer v2.4.0 only
   - **Impact**: `/etc/sudoers.d/` cleanup now guaranteed

3. **Unquoted Variable Expansion** (Medium)
   - **Risk**: Malformed paths or flags could break execution
   - **Fix**: Proper quoting throughout macOS scripts
   - **Affected**: macOS installer v2.4.0 only

#### Recommendation

If you installed v2.4.0 on macOS:
1. **Download and install v2.4.1** to get security fixes
2. **Verify no leftover sudo files**: `ls /etc/sudoers.d/kivun-brew-temp` (should not exist)
3. **Review your config.txt** if you edited it manually

Windows installer is **not affected** by these vulnerabilities.

See `SECURITY_REVIEW_v2.4.0.md` for full technical details.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-04-12

### Changed - Windows & macOS
- **Claude Code native installer**: Migrated from deprecated `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` to Anthropic's official native installer
  - **Windows**: `curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.cmd` (CMD)
  - **macOS**: `curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh` (Bash)
  - **Why**: npm package is deprecated; native installer is the official supported method
  - **Benefits**: Works on Windows Server and LTSC builds where winget is unavailable; avoids PowerShell execution policy restrictions
  - **Node.js still required**: Only for statusline display (`statusline.mjs`, `configure-statusline.js`, `apply-wt-settings.js`)

### Changed - Windows Only
- **Dependency installation via `install.cmd`**: Replaced bundled MSI/EXE installers with a new `install.cmd` script that downloads Node.js and Git via `curl.exe` (built-in on Windows 10 1803+), with automatic winget fallback if curl is unavailable
- **No PowerShell dependency**: The entire install chain is now pure CMD - works in environments where PowerShell execution policy is restricted
- **Smaller installer**: No bundled binaries; Node.js and Git are downloaded at install time from official sources
- **NSIS sections simplified**: SecNodeJS, SecGit, SecWindowsTerminal, and SecClaudeCode now delegate to `install.cmd` with `/node`, `/git`, `/wt`, `/claude` flags
- **PATH refresh**: `install.cmd` re-reads PATH from the registry after each install, so subsequent steps see newly installed tools without requiring a restart
- **Installer messaging updated**: Welcome page, error messages, and section descriptions now reference the native installer instead of npm

### Added - macOS Feature Parity
- **Folder picker dialog**: Desktop shortcut now shows native macOS folder picker (AppleScript `choose folder`) before launching Claude - matches Windows folder picker experience
- **Right-click context menu**: Finder Quick Action adds "Open with ClaudeCode Launchpad" to right-click menu on any folder (appears in Services menu)
- **Language configuration**: `~/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode-Launchpad/config.txt` with same options as Windows (24+ languages including Hebrew, Arabic, Persian, etc.)
- **Configuration file**: macOS now supports `config.txt` with `RESPONSE_LANGUAGE`, `TERMINAL_COLOR`, and `CLAUDE_FLAGS` settings - full feature parity with Windows

### Added - Windows Only
- `source/install.cmd`: Standalone dependency installer - can also be run outside the NSIS wizard to repair or reinstall components
- `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`: Added "Download failed during installation" section

## [2.3.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added
- **Optional color theme**: Installer checkbox (checked by default) - uncheck to keep your existing terminal colors instead of applying the Kivun light-blue theme
- **New no-color WT fragment** (`claudecode-launchpad-wt-fragment-nocolor.json`): registers the WT profile without overriding the color scheme
- **One-time Claude flags**: After typing a folder path in the text-input fallback, a prompt asks for optional Claude flags (e.g. `--continue`). Flags are written to `kivun-claude-flags.txt`, read at launch, then deleted
- **Persistent Claude flags**: `CLAUDE_FLAGS=` key in `config.txt` - set once, applied on every launch
- `docs/RELEASING.md`: Release checklist documenting required assets and build steps for every release

### Changed
- `claudecode-launchpad.bat`: Phase 2 config re-read moved before ANSI color block so `TERMINAL_COLOR` is available when Windows Terminal launches via `--run`
- `apply-wt-settings.js` is now only executed when the color theme checkbox is checked
- WT fragment copy is now conditional: color fragment for checked, no-color fragment for unchecked

## [2.2.0] - 2026-04-01

### Changed
- **VBS → JScript migration**: All `.vbs` scripts replaced with `.js` for better compatibility
- **Statusline fix**: Second line now shows on session start (configures `lines: 2` by default)
- **Folder picker paste support**: Cancelling the folder picker now falls through to a text input prompt where users can paste or type a folder path
- Icon renamed to `claude_icon.ico`
- NSIS installer updated for all file changes

## [2.1.0] - 2026-03-31

### Changed
- **Renamed product** from "Kivun Terminal" to "ClaudeCode Launchpad CLI" (v2.0+; v1.x keeps original name)
- Fixed WT color fallback: self-invoking ANSI pattern (`--run` flag) replaces profile dependency
  - WT path now calls `claudecode-launchpad.bat --run` instead of `cmd /c claude`
  - Phase 2 applies ANSI RGB escape sequences (#C8E6FF) directly inside the terminal
  - Colors work regardless of whether the WT profile/fragment is loaded
- Removed `color B0` fallback (replaced by 24-bit ANSI RGB)
- CMD fallback reuses the same ANSI color logic via `goto :run_claude`

## [2.0.2] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- Integrated `statusline.mjs` into both Windows (NSIS) and macOS (.pkg) installers
- Windows installer sets `CLAUDE_CODE_STATUSLINE` system environment variable and broadcasts change
- macOS installer copies statusline to `/usr/local/share/kivun/` and adds export to shell profile
- Uninstaller cleans up the environment variable on both platforms

### Changed
- Updated `START_HERE.txt` for v2.0.1 (removed v1.x references)
- Updated `SECURITY.md` with real policy and v2.0.x support
- Updated `LICENSE` third-party section (removed WSL/Ubuntu/Konsole/Hebrew Fonts, added Windows Terminal)
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude `bundled/` directory
- Updated macOS build workflow to include `statusline.mjs` in .pkg payload

## [2.0.1] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed
- Fixed apply-wt-settings.vbs corrupting Windows Terminal settings.json when adding properties to the Kivun Terminal profile. The insertion point landed inside the opening `{` of the profile object, splitting the `"guid"` value and duplicating properties. The script now inserts after the first newline following the brace so existing fields stay intact.
- Fixed folder-picker.vbs writing a UTF-8 BOM to kivun-workdir.txt. The BOM prefix made the path appear relative, so Windows Terminal concatenated it with the install directory (e.g. `C:\...\Kivun\﻿C:\Users\...`), causing error 0x8007010b "directory name is invalid". The file is now written without BOM, matching write-path.vbs.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-13

### Major Release - Windows + macOS

Complete rewrite removing WSL/Ubuntu/Konsole dependency. Claude Code now runs natively on Windows. Added macOS installer.
