# ClaudeCode Launchpad CLI - Quick Start Guide

## What is ClaudeCode Launchpad CLI?

ClaudeCode Launchpad CLI is a Claude Code installer for Windows and macOS. It sets up Node.js, Claude Code, and a preconfigured terminal environment.

## Installation

### Windows

> **Note:** The installer may close open terminal windows (Windows Terminal, cmd.exe) during setup- particularly when installing Git or Windows Terminal. Save your work in any open terminals before running the installer.

1. Run `ClaudeCode_Launchpad_CLI_Setup.exe` as Administrator
2. Follow the wizard:
   - Enter your name
   - Choose response language (English or Hebrew)
   - Select components (Windows Terminal recommended, Git optional)
3. Done! Launch from the desktop shortcut.

### macOS

> **Note:** An internet connection is required. The installer downloads all dependencies via Homebrew - no binaries are bundled in the .pkg.

1. Download `ClaudeCode_Launchpad_CLI_Setup_<version>.pkg` from the [latest release](https://github.com/noambrand/kivun-terminal/releases/latest)
2. **Double-click** the `.pkg` - macOS will block it with *"cannot be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software"*. Close the alert.
3. Go to  → **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, scroll to the bottom, and click **Allow Anyway** next to the blocked installer.
4. **Double-click the `.pkg` again** to run it. Click **Open** in the confirmation dialog.
5. Enter your Mac password when prompted (admin access is needed to install Homebrew, Node.js, Git, and Claude Code).
6. Wait for the installer to finish, then open **Terminal** (Finder → Applications → Utilities → Terminal).
7. Type `claude` and press Enter.

On first launch, Claude Code will ask for your account details or Anthropic API key.

**Navigating to a folder in Terminal:** Drag any folder from Finder into the Terminal window - the path is inserted automatically (spaces escaped). Prefix it with `cd ` and press Enter to navigate there.

**If something goes wrong:** Check the install log at `/tmp/kivun_install.log`.

## Configuration

## Status Bar

ClaudeCode Launchpad CLI adds a status bar at the bottom of Claude Code. It updates automatically and shows:

```
Opus 4.6 | context used:23% | my-project | total tokens:45K | duration:12m | /Users/me/my-project
```

**Fields:**

- **Model** - which Claude model is active. Green = Opus, Yellow = Sonnet or Haiku.
- **Context used** - how much of the context window has been consumed.
  - Green: under 40% - plenty of room
  - Yellow: 40–69% - getting there
  - Red: 70%+ - running low, consider starting a new session
- **Project** - the name of your current working folder (cyan).
- **Total tokens** - combined input and output tokens used this session (e.g. "45K", "1.2M").
- **Duration** - how long the session has been running (e.g. "12m" or "1:30" for hours).
- **Full path** - the complete path to your working directory.

The status bar is installed automatically - no configuration needed.
